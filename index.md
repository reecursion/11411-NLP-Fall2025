    <h2>Welcome to Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <p>This course is an introduction to natural language processing, one of the most exciting and important fields of artificial intelligence. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines insights and methodologies from machine learning, theoretical computer science, linguistics, and the social sciences.</p>
    
    <p>In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of NLP that will allow you apply natural language processing not just in the current technological environment (which is heavily focused on self-supervised language models) but in the future, when new technologies have achieved the state of the art. Students will learn not just how to develop models, but how to develop data sets and use evaluation metrics so that these models can be trained and evaluated.</p>
